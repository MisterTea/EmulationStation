{"name":"ESMAME","tagline":"A simple frontend and launcher for MAME","body":"# ESMAME\r\n\r\nESMAME is a fork of EmulationStation that is designed to make playing arcade and console games on MAME extremely simple.\r\n\r\n## Why make ESMAME?\r\n\r\nMAME is an AMAZING emulator, but many people don't use it because (1) it is too hard to configure and (2) it isn't obvious that MAME supports consoles.\r\n\r\nSince MAME is a frustrating experience, people have turned to emulator containers like Retroarch that try to wrap many emulators.  MAME supports almost all of the systems that Retroarch supports (minus PSP and real-time N64) in a single binary that only needs to be configured once.\r\n\r\n## How to install\r\n\r\n1. [Download ESMAME from here](http://10ghost.net/ESMAMEDownloads/).  Open the ESMAME folder\r\n- Get Roms from Pleauredome and put into the Roms folder\r\n    - Tested using the \"MAME 0.166 ROMs\" torrent\r\n    - There should be no sub-directories: all of the 7z files go in the Roms folder\r\n- Get software from Pleasuredome and put into the Software folder\r\n    - Tested using the \"MAME 0.166 Software List ROMs\" torrent\r\n    - There should be a sub-folder for each machine and each sub-folder should contain 7z files (e.g. nes/*.7z)\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\n\r\n- run launch.bat\r\n- Wait until the ES frontend starts up\r\n- Change systems with left-right arrow keys, and select a system with 'a'\r\n- Select a game with 'up'/'down' or faster by holding 'd'/'c'\r\n- Go back to the main menu with 'z'\r\n- Change settings with 'enter'\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
