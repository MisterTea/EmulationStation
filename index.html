      marked("# ESMAME\n\nESMAME is a fork of EmulationStation that is designed to make playing arcade and console games on MAME extremely simple.\n\n## Why make ESMAME?\n\nMAME is an AMAZING emulator, but many people don't use it because (1) it is too hard to configure and (2) it isn't obvious that MAME supports consoles.\n\nSince MAME is a frustrating experience, people have turned to emulator containers like Retroarch that try to wrap many emulators.  MAME supports almost all of the systems that Retroarch supports (minus PSP and real-time N64) in a single binary that only needs to be configured once.\n\n## How to install\n\n1. [Download ESMAME from here](https://github.com/MisterTea/EmulationStation/releases).\n- Open the ESMAME folder\n- [Get mame from here](http://mamedev.org/release.html).  Make sure you download the 64-bit version if you are running a 64-bit OS.\n- Get Roms from Pleasuredome and put into the Roms folder\n    - Tested using the \"MAME 0.166 ROMs\" torrent\n    - There should be no sub-directories: all of the 7z files go in the Roms folder\n- Get software from Pleasuredome and put into the Software folder\n    - Tested using the \"MAME 0.166 Software List ROMs\" torrent\n    - There should be a sub-folder for each machine and each sub-folder should contain 7z files (e.g. nes/*.7z)\n- Get extras from Pleasuredome and put into the Extras folder\n    - Tested using the \"MAME 0.165 EXTRAs\" torrent\n    - there should be cheat.7z in the folder, along with several other folders and files\n\n## How to run\n\n- run launch.bat\n- Wait until the ES frontend starts up\n- Change systems with left-right arrow keys, and select a system with 'a'\n- Select a game with 'up'/'down' or faster by holding 'd'/'c'\n- Go back to the main menu with 'z'\n\n## Keyboard controls\n\nBy default, ESMAME supports keyboard controls.  You can also configure one or more joysticks using the instructions below\n\n### Frontend keyboard controls\n\nThe frontend controls are for running ESMAME when not playing a game.\n\n![Frontend Keyboard Control Map](images/frontend-keyboard-layout.png)\n\n### In-Game keyboard controls\n\nThe in-game keyboard controls are mapped to MAME actions.\n\n![In-Game Keyboard Control Map](images/ingame-keyboard-layout.png)\n\n## How to set up a joystick\n\n- Enter settings with 'enter'\n- Press the down arrow to go to 'Configure Input' and press 'a'\n- Hold any button on your joystick to begin the configuration process\n- The 6-button inputs (top-left and top-right) and the shoulder buttons (L1/R1/L2/R2/L3/R3) are exclusive, so you can map them to the same buttons if appropriate.\n\n## How to get game art \n\n- Enter settings with 'enter'\n- Press 'a' to enter Scraper\n- Choose 'Scrape Now'\n- Press the down arrow until you reach the START button and press 'a'\n- Wait.\n");
